There are many programming languages: C, Lisp, Basic, APL, Intercal...
Each has its specificities and may be efficient in a different way.
They generally rely on a compiler to work.
The compiler transforms code written in something similar to human language into a more primitive form.

This primitive form is called assembly language when displayed in a human-readable format, or machine language when displayed under the format read by the microprocessor. Much like there are many programming languages, there are many assembly languages: at least one per processor family, sometimes even one per single processor.

Of course, knowing an assembly language for a microprocessor may not be enough to be efficient: proces-
sors arenâ€™t the only components in machines
